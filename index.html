        <p>Does your computer run slowly? Running low on memory? Use PC Cleanup to quickly optimize your computer in seconds. PC Cleanup, handcrafted by SlipSerum and hosted by jHeight, was made due to the lack of free, non-trial products that would clean your PC. PC Cleanup was then made and has had over 100 downloads on its launch day. Enjoy PC Cleanup today!</p>
